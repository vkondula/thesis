# The following variables will likely need to be customized, depending on where
# and how you built LLVM & Clang. They can be overridden by setting them on the
# make command line: "make VARNAME=VALUE", etc.

# LLVM_SRC_PATH is the path to the root of the checked out source code. This
# directory should contain the configure script, the include/ and lib/
# directories of LLVM, Clang in tools/clang/, etc.
#
# The most recent build from source of LLVM I did used the following cmake
# invocation:
#
# $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
#         -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
#         -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-DLLVM_ENABLE_DUMP \
#         -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-DLLVM_ENABLE_DUMP \
#         -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" \
#         -G Ninja
#
# Note that this is a release build with assertions enabled, and with
# LLVM_ENABLE_DUMP explicitly passed. This is required to get the LLVM IR-level
# 'dump' methods to work. With debug builds, assertions should be enabled by
# default. Also note that a fairly recent version of cmake is required; the
# latest I've been using is 3.5.2
#
# Alternatively, if you're building vs. a binary distribution of LLVM
# (downloaded from llvm.org), then LLVM_SRC_PATH can point to the main untarred
# directory of the binary download (the directory that has bin/, lib/, include/
# and other directories inside).
# See the build_vs_released_binary.sh script for an example.
LLVM_SRC_PATH := /usr/lib/llvm-3.8

# LLVM_BUILD_PATH is the directory in which you built LLVM - where you ran
# configure or cmake.
# For linking vs. a binary build of LLVM, point to the main untarred directory.
# LLVM_BIN_PATH is the directory where binaries are placed by the LLVM build
# process. It should contain the tools like opt, llc and clang. The default
# reflects a release build with CMake and Ninja. binary build of LLVM, point it
# to the bin/ directory.
LLVM_BUILD_PATH := $$HOME/llvm/build/svn-ninja-release

# CXX has to be a fairly modern C++ compiler that supports C++11. gcc 4.8 and
# higher or Clang 3.2 and higher are recommended. Best of all, if you build LLVM
# from sources, use the same compiler you built LLVM with.
# Note: starting with release 3.7, llvm-config will inject flags that gcc may
# not support (for example '-Wcovered-switch-default'). If you run into this
# problem, build with CXX set to a modern clang++ binary instead of g++.
